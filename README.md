# AlternateRealitiesRepo

:> Fall 2021

Project 1 Details: 

This is a project of a ghost town whose inhabitants still linger, and with them are monsters. 

To start the project, go into the assets folder, click on scenes and then main. 

Once you have done that, all you have to is press on the play button on the top menu. 

This will take you into game mode. You can observe the scene through the game screen, or click back into the scene screen and observe the scene being alive. 

If you are using a headset, repeat the same steps after connecting through Oculus Link. The play button should be enough to get you in the scene direclty. 

Happy Exploring!
